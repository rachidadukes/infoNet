In my role, I consistently demonstrate a strong commitment to customer focus by actively listening to the needs of both internal and external customers. A recent example is when I worked with a client who had specific requirements for an application feature. I collaborated closely with the development team, ensuring that we met the customerâ€™s expectations while adhering to project timelines. This resulted in a positive feedback score from the client and the successful delivery of the project.

Additionally, I strive to be proactive by regularly following up with customers to gather feedback and address concerns before they escalate. One key area of growth for me is improving the speed of my follow-ups, and I plan to work on streamlining my workflow to enhance responsiveness.
