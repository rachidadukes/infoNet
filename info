In my experience working across vertical and horizontal teams, I have actively contributed to improving dependency planning and collaboration between business units such as Branch Operations and Contact Center Operations. One key project I worked on involved implementing process changes that helped streamline communication between these teams, ensuring that dependencies were clearly outlined and managed effectively.

I also value active listening and candid communication, which I practice daily in my role. By maintaining an open and professional dialogue, I’ve been able to build strong relationships across teams, allowing us to navigate challenges together and embrace change with minimal disruption. This approach has not only improved team collaboration but has also fostered a culture of transparency and trust."

This type of response demonstrates your ability to collaborate, listen, and communicate across teams, as well as your role in process improvement efforts. Let me know if you’d like to tailor this further to your specific experience.
