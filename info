A sample answer could look something like this:

"In alignment with the goal of expanding my capabilities and supporting the ETS framework, 
I have consistently pursued opportunities to grow my skill set. For example, 
I have completed courses on Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) and have applied modern deployment techniques,
such as using CI/CD pipelines, in my role as a .NET developer. Additionally, Iâ€™ve leveraged internal training programs and external resources like online certifications
to continuously enhance my skills based on my role requirements. This has not only contributed to my personal development but also helped improve team efficiency and project
outcomes."

Let me know if you'd like to refine or adjust the response based on your specific experience.
